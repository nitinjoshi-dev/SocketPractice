A simple project to study the use of blocking and non blocking i/o in java using sockets.

This projects creates a server and a client that can communicate with each other using sockets.
I have added blocking server/client implementation.

The non blocking server/client implementation is taken from Jenkov's [nio-server example](https://github.com/jjenkov/java-nio-server).
